# Critical Questions for Big Data

> Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea'"

The concept of `Raw Data` refers to a dataset, which has not been processed by others. The concept is ideal, but, as the article states, an oxymoron. The main reason is that the process of interpretation always exists during data modeling and data analysis, which may not correctly represent the so-called objective truth.  Besides, the data sources themselves will do data cleaning, which will bring a great bias to the `Raw Data`.

> What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.

Just like the Ford example, with the great development of the tools, it will reshape people's view of mass production. It is not only because the new tools can reduce the previous work time but also it brings a perspective that might go beyond the original view. Just like the example of CompStat, it introduces a new view of inspecting the crime rate.

On the other side, a new tool might also change the relationship between people and their tools. In some cases, the situation is that tools tell people what the next step is, and people will perform it without a doubt.

> In which way is Twitter data limited?

- Twitter users can not represent all people. Moreover, in terms of the samples, some twitters users have multiple accounts and some even do not have one account which results in bias and wrong weights towards the result.
- Also, social media like Twitter, will do self-censorship in terms of content. This behaviour will result in another bais.

> If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.

The requirement of login should not be the criteria, as posting data to the Internet does not mean that one allows their data to be researched by others.
