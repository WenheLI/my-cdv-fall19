This article reflects on how the data visualization in Augmented Reality goes on and summaries five advices/comments from the past tries. I really like the point they made that `3D charts are moslty unreadable`. From my experience, the main reason here is that though the chart is 3D, we are still displaing it via 2D medium -- Screen. In this case, if AR can involve in, things will change.

The is a quite interesting data invetsigation that is about The Simpsons, an animation. It coves a lot of things like what they said, who did they talk with, and the emotion witnin the words. The author shows these by applying different charts like heatmap, pie chart, and bars. The most interesting part is that it treats the characters as real humen. Also, it devotes a lot of time to get detailed data.
