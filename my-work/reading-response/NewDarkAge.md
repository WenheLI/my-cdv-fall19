> Information and violence are utterly and inextricably linked, and the weaponisation of information is accelerated by technologies that purport to assert control over the world.

This sentence reminds me that the information is not limited to commericial usgae. Previously, when I heard the word information, what comes into my mind is to use information to do merchandise and customers' analysis. However, this article brings me back to the real that the data/information could be used in different ways.

> The subsea cables girding South America are owned by corportations based in Madrid, even as countries there struggle to control their own oil profits.

This sentence shows the what behinds a data/network. Since the network or say the Internet requires maintainance, the Internet is controled by the maintainor. In this case, the Internet is just like the oil. Moreover, the data is generated from the Internet largely, which means the data is also controled by the maintainor.

> In the present, the extraction, refinement, use of data/oil pollutes the ground and air. It spills. ... It  enforces computational thinking upon us, driving the deep divisions in society ...

It makes a perfect analog between the data and oil, where much extraction and usgae will lead to a negative influence on people/surroundings.
